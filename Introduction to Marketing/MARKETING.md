### Why is it important to a marketer to decide which customer they will serve?

### What markets will we serve? (target market)

### How can we serve these customer best? (value proposition)

## Production Concept

Consumers will favor products that are available and highly affordable.

* The production concept is still a useful philosophy in some situations. For example in the highly competitive, price-sensitive Chinese market, both personal computer maker Lenovo and home appliance maker Haier dominate through low labor costs, high production efficiency, and mass distribution.
* The production concept can lead to marketing myopia and losing sight of the real objective- satisfying customer needs and building customer relationships.

## Product Concept

Consumers favor products that offer the most quality, performance and features.

* The focus is on continues product improvements. Product quality and improvement are important parts of most marketing strategies. However, focusing *only* on the company's products can also lead to marketing myopia.

## Selling Concept

Consumers will not buy enough of the firm's products unless the firm undertakes a large-scale selling and promotion effort.

* The selling concept is typically practiced with unsought goods - those that buyers do not normally think of buying, such as life insurance or blood donations.
* Such aggressive selling, however, carries high risks. It focuses on creating sales transactions rather than on building long term, profitable customer relationships.

## Building Customer Relationships

**Customer Relationship Management** is the overall process of building and maintaining <u>profitable customer relationships</u> by delivering superior customer value and satisfaction.

**Customer-perceived value** is the customer's evaluation of the difference between all the benefits and all the costs of a market offering relative to those of competing offers.

**Customer-perceived value** is the difference between total customer perceived benefits and customer cost

**Customer satisfaction** is the extent to which perceived performance matches a buyer's expectations.

## Customer Satisfaction

**Customer satisfaction** depends on the product's perceived performance relative to a buyer's expectations.

* If the product's performance falls short of expectations, the customer is dissatisfied.
* If performance matches expectations, the customer is satisfied.
* If performance exceed expectations, the customer is highly satisfied or delighted.

## Managing Customer Relationships and Capturing the Customer Value

**Customer lifetime value** is the value of the entire stream of purchases that the customer would make over a lifetime of patronage.

**Share of customer** is the portion of the customer’s purchasing that a company gets in its product categories.

> Banks want to increase “share of wallet.” 
>
> Supermarkets and restaurants want to get more “share of stomach.” 
>
> Car companies want to increase “share of garage,” 
>
> Airlines want greater “share of travel.”

**Tools** cross-sell & up-sell 

**Customer equity** is the total combined customer lifetime values of all of the company’s customers (company’s current and potential customers).

Whereas sales and market share reflect the past, customer equity suggests the future.
